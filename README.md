# Lab-06

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

Time to give Qualified.io a try.

First, We'll make sure everyone can get onto the platform.
Next, we'll work through an example drill together.
Finally, you'll have time to work through the assigned drills.

## GETTING ONTO QUALIFIED.IO

You should have gotten an email invite (well, two) from Qualified. Following the link in the email will prompt you to create an account on the system (if you haven't already).

## WORKING THROUGH A DRILL TOGETHER

So Qualified has two concepts: _assessments_ and _challenges_. A _challenge_ is like any one of the REPL drills you've done up to now: you've got to write code that will allow you to pass some tests.

An _assessment_ is a group of one or more _challenges_. I haven't decided whether to move to a "one challenge per assessment" or "clump all challenges that are due on a given day into one assessment" system or not. (As you'll see, moving between challenges in an assessment is a bit weird/annoying.)

Moving forward, for our purposes, a _drill_ and a _challenge_ are the **same thing**.

Let's work through the **Lab-06-Practice** assessment together.

## YOUR SKILL DRILLS

You should now have the ability to work on Qualified on your own. So get at it!
